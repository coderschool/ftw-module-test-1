    <h1> HTML Test </h1>
    <p> Now, we'll need to create a HTML frontend for our JavaScript. If you haven't done the JavaScript exercises, go do those now.</p>

    <p>Replace this placeholder HTML with a calculator, that satisfies the following stories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user can enter their height, in cm, into a text input field.</li>
        <li>The user can enter their weight, in kg, into a text input field.</li>
        <li>The user can press a "calculate" button, that displays the user's calculated BMI.</li>
        <li>The user sees a box, next to the form, with the results of the calculation (BMI and Diagnosis).</li> 
        <li>The user sees their calculated BMI, in large black text.</li>
        <li>The user sees text, to the right of the numeric BMI, that displays "obese", "overweight", "normal weight", or "underweight".</li>
        <li>The user sees the result in large red text if the result is "obese" or "underweight".</li>
        <li>The user sees the result in large dark yellow text if the result is "overweight".</li>
        <li>The user sees the result in large  green text if the result is "normal weight".</li> 

    </ul>

    <p> As always, feel free to make things more beautiful. This is only the bare minimum. Good luck!</p>
